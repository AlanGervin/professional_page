        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Long time system admin. I have always had a passion for computers. I decided I wanted to really push myself and get a job in web or software development. 
          I want to explore and create more and I believe the software field is where I can do just that. I had been studying on random different site and had made it pretty far on 
          freecodecamp.com but I ended up trying out the program on codecademy.com. So far I've made it 62% through their lesson plan and I have learned a lot. 
          I even started building this page with git now that I know the concepts and how to utilize it correctly.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="projects" class="container tab-pane fade"><br>
        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <p>In the past I have built out the django library project to interact with the sqllite DB from a webpage. 
          I learned a lot in that project about the django admin page and access control. I have made myself a few professional pages and this last year took on learning python 3.
        You can even download the version of the classic game Go-Fish that I made which is located at <a href="https://github.com/Swervin-op/Go-Fish">https://github.com/Swervin-op/Go-Fish</p></a>
        This was an early learning attempt with python. Since writing the program I have become aware of classes and the "DRY" principal meaning do not repeat yourself in code.
