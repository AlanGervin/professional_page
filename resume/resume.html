      <p><span class='bold'>Objective:</span><br>
        Seeking a position in a junior role doing programming. I am highly interested in developing a career in the field of programming. 
        I have many background skills which lead me to believe I can not only be an asset as a programmer but also in pushing through tasks 
        that are required from the programmer perspective such as asset acquirement and dealing with data center 	personnel.
